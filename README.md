# Fedimint NixOS Deployment on Hetzner

### Security

This deployment utilizes an encrypted disk for enhanced security. Please note that there are two distinct SSH ports available:
- Port 2222: This port is used for secure boot SSH, which unlocks the disk during system restarts.
- Port 22: This is the standard SSH port for accessing the system.

Ensure you connect using the appropriate port based on your requirements.
